  Abstract =	 {For many applications it is useful to sample from a finite
                  set of objects in accordance with some particular
                  distribution. One approach is to run an ergodic (i.e.,
                  irreducible aperiodic) Markov chain whose stationary
                  distribution is the desired distribution on this set; after
                  the Markov chain has run for M steps, with M sufficiently
                  large, the distribution governing the state of the chain
                  approximates the desired distribution. Unfortunately, it can
                  be difficult to determine how large M needs to be. We
                  describe a simple variant of this method that determines on
                  its own when to stop and that outputs samples in exact
                  accordance with the desired distribution. The method uses
                  couplings which have also Flayed a role in other sampling
                  schemes; however, rather than running the coupled chains
                  from the present into the future, one runs from a distant
                  point in the past up until the present, where the distance
                  into the past that one needs to go is determined during the
                  running of the algorithm itself. If the state space has a
                  partial order that is preserved under the moves of the
                  Markov chain, then the coupling is often particularly
                  efficient. Using our approach, one can sample from the Gibbs
                  distributions associated with various statistical mechanics
                  models (including Ising, random-cluster, ice, and dimer) or
                  choose uniformly at random from the elements of a finite
                  distributive lattice.  (C) 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  Abstract =	 {The Markov chain Monte Carlo method is a general technique
                  for obtaining samples from a probability distribution, in
                  earlier work, Re showed that for many applications one can
                  modify the Markov chain Monte Carlo method so as to remove
                  all bias in the output resulting from the biased choice of
                  an initial state for the chain; we have called this method
                  Coupling From The Past (CFTP). Here we describe this method
                  in a fashion that should make our ideas accessible to
                  researchers from diverse areas. Our expository strategy is
                  to avoid proofs and focus on sample applications.},
