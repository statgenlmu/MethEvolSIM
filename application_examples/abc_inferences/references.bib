  abstract =	 "{The DNA of most vertebrates is depleted in CpG
                  dinucleotide: a C followed by a G in the 5′ to 3′
                  direction. CpGs are the target for DNA methylation, a
                  chemical modification of cytosine (C) heritable during cell
                  division and the most well-characterized epigenetic
                  mechanism. The remaining CpGs tend to cluster in regions
                  referred to as CpG islands (CGI). Knowing CGI locations is
                  important because they mark functionally relevant epigenetic
                  loci in development and disease. For various mammals,
                  including human, a readily available and widely used list of
                  CGI is available from the UCSC Genome Browser. This list was
                  derived using algorithms that search for regions satisfying
                  a definition of CGI proposed by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer
                  more than 20 years ago. Recent findings, enabled by advances
                  in technology that permit direct measurement of epigenetic
                  endpoints at a whole-genome scale, motivate the need to
                  adapt the current CGI definition. In this paper, we propose
                  a procedure, guided by hidden Markov models, that permits an
                  extensible approach to detecting CGI. The main advantage of
                  our approach over others is that it summarizes the evidence
                  for CGI status as probability scores. This provides
                  flexibility in the definition of a CGI and facilitates the
                  creation of CGI lists for other species. The utility of this
                  approach is demonstrated by generating the first CGI lists
                  for invertebrates, and the fact that we can create CGI lists
                  that substantially increases overlap with recently
                  discovered epigenetic marks. A CGI list and the probability
                  scores, as a function of genome location, for each species
                  are available at http://www.rafalab.org.}",
