Description: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved on genomic stability, gene regulation, development and disease. DNA methylation occurs mainly through the addition of a methyl group to cytosines, leading to different methylation patterns. Tissue-specific methylation patterns imply genomic regions with different characteristic methylation levels, e.g. regions associated to promoters of expressed genes tend to be unmethylated.  MethEvolRSIM is a model-based simulation software for the generation and modification of cytosine methylation patterns along a given tree, which can be a genealogy of cells within an organism, a coalescent tree of DNA sequences sampled from a population, or a species tree.
