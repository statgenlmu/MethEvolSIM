Description: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved in genomic stability,
      gene regulation, development and disease.
      DNA methylation occurs mainly through the addition of a methyl group to cytosines.
      Tissue-specific methylation patterns lead to genomic regions with different characteristic
      methylation levels.
      E.g. in vertebrates so-called CpG islands that are associated to promoter regions of
      expressed genes tend to be unmethylated.
      MethEvolRSIM is a model-based simulation software for the generation and modification
      of cytosine methylation patterns along a given tree, which can be a genealogy of
      cells within an organism, a coalescent tree of DNA sequences sampled from a population, or a species tree.
      The simulations are based on an extension of the model of
      Grosser & Metzler (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3438-5> and allows for changes of
      the methylation states at single cytosine positions as well as simultaneous changes of methylation
      frequencies in genomic structures like CpG islands.
